 Foundations - Higher-level programming ― Python

## General

```

Why Python programming is awesome
What is an object
What is the difference between a class and an object or instance
What is the difference between immutable object and mutable object
What is a reference
What is an assignment
What is an alias
How to know if two variables are identical
How to know if two variables are linked to the same object
How to display the variable identifier (which is the memory address in the CPython implementation)
What is mutable and immutable
What are the built-in mutable types
What are the built-in immutable types
How does Python pass variables to functions
