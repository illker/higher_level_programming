![python](https://miro.medium.com/max/757/1*gWvTBke0c8BFLGR8u_5zSg.jpeg)


 Foundations - Higher-level programming  Python


## Background Context

In this project, you will link two amazing worlds: Databases and Python!

In the first part, you will use the module MySQLdb to connect to a MySQL database and execute your SQL queries.

In the second part, you will use the module SQLAlchemy (dont ask me how to pronounce it) an Object Relational Mapper (ORM).

The biggest difference is: no more SQL queries! Indeed, the purpose of an ORM is to abstract the storage to the usage. With an ORM, your biggest concern will be What can I do with my objects and not How this object is stored? where? when?. You wont write any SQL queries only Python code. Last thing, your code wont be storage type dependent. You will be able to change your storage easily without re-writing your entire project.
